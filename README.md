# eProtect iframe coding example
Example showing how to use Vantiv eProtect Enterprise with an iFrame based integration. Excuse the ugly formatting. I've not had a chance to do any styling.
This is an update to the Vantic eProtect Enterprise documentation correcting some errors in the documentation. When the documentation is correct I'll remove this repository.
For details see http://developer/vantiv.com
